This effect was pointed out in https://cds.cern.ch/record/2053189/files/Eur.%20Phys.%20J.%20C%2076%20(2016)%20238.pdf but without really getting into it and how it might be a useful handle at high pT.

This is really trying to get at the same thing. But misses the pT scale of the fragmentation and the relevant frames.

"Of course, there are well-known caveats to this picture of jet generation, which go under the name of “sample dependence”. For instance, “quark” jets from the Z+jet process are not exactly identical to “quark” jets from the dijet process due to soft color correlations with the entire event [37], though these correlations are power suppressed in the small-jet-radius limit [41–43]."


"Here, we assume that sample-dependent effects can either be quantified or mitigated, taking Eq. (2) as the starting assumption for our analysis."
