This effect was pointed out in https://cds.cern.ch/record/2053189/files/Eur.%20Phys.%20J.%20C%2076%20(2016)%20238.pdf but without really getting into it and how it might be a useful handle at high pT.

This is really trying to get at the same thing. But misses the pT scale of the fragmentation and the relevant frames.
