# FragmentationStudy


Using MadGraph, we aim to produce particle level samples of pure QCD, like:

```
p p > j j j
```

and also samples that happen via boosted color singlets such as

```
p p > z j (z > j j)
```

And then we'll compare their fragmentation as a function of lab frame pT.



This effect was pointed out in https://cds.cern.ch/record/2053189/files/Eur.%20Phys.%20J.%20C%2076%20(2016)%20238.pdf but without really getting into it and how it might be a useful handle at high pT.
